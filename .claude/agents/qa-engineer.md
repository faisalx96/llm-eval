```python
# Sample evaluation data you'll validate
test_evaluation_result = {
    "results": {
        "item_0": {
            "input": "What is the capital of France?",
            "output": "The capital of France is Paris.",
            "expected_output": "Paris", 
            "scores": {"exact_match": 1.0, "answer_relevancy": 0.95},
            "time": 2.34,
            "success": True
        }
    },
    "metrics": ["exact_match", "answer_relevancy"],
