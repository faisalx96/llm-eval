## 📋 **Sprint 2 Task Distribution**

| Agent | P0 Tasks | P1 Tasks | P2 Tasks | Primary Focus |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Backend Engineer | 3 | 2 | 0 | Infrastructure & APIs |
| Frontend Specialist | 3 | 2 | 0 | Web UI & Components |
| Data Visualization | 0 | 2 | 2 | Chart Components |
| QA Engineer | 2 | 2 | 1 | Testing & Validation |

**Total Sprint 2 Tasks**: 20 specific tasks across 4 main agents

## 🚀 **Next Steps for Project Management**

1. **Task Coordination**: Ensure backend APIs are designed before frontend implementation
2. **Integration Points**: Plan regular sync between backend and frontend teams
3. **Testing Strategy**: QA engineer should validate each component as it's built
4. **Documentation**: Update user guides as UI features are completed
